# cocktail_calc_2
The reason for this release is to completely redo the Cocktail Calculator App.
The old version has so much spaghetti code that it was worth it to just restart from scratch. 

##Summary
This web app will allow you to enter a single cocktail recipe, and number of batches.
You will than be given the proportions necessary to create batches of the desired quantity.

One of the key features is the automatic water dilution depending on type of preparation method (e.g. stir, shake, build).
